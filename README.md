I'm a passionate computer science student exploring the world of intelligent systems. The path may be filled with obstacles, but it's also full of inspiration and discovery.


- 🌱 Currently exploring software development, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and large language models (LLMs).
- 👋 Fascinated by computer architecture, natural language processing (NLP), the mathematical theories behind modern techniques, and the high-performance execution of programs
- 🛠️ I’ve worked on web projects using Vue 3 and Django, and enjoy building systems that solve real-world problems.
- 🧰 Tech stack: C++, Python, MySQL, Vue3, Django, Docker, Nginx, Langchain

💭 I aspire to be a versatile developer - a jack of all trades - who creatively harnesses technology to make meaningful impact.


I believe that knowledge is not only structural but also sensory; it has color, taste, and emotional resonace. As humans, we are deeply emotional beings, and just as a well-designed graphical user interface(GUI) can captivate us, elegant code can inspire and delight.


To me, the true power of technology lies not only in its functionality, but in how imaginatively we apply it to impove the world around us.
